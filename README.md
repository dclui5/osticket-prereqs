<h2>STEP 1 : </h2> Start by creating a Resource Group within your Subscription (i.e. a department pertaining to a company). Next, within that resource group you will want to establish at least two VM's where you can then download the software helpdesk ticket system named OS Ticket.

<h2>STEP 2 : </h2> Now, having the environment established. The post installation phase will involve setting up SLA's among other help desk ticket settings that administrators have to initially set up such as configuring roles, departments, and teams. Once OS Ticket settings are in place, follow up by setting up hypothetically submitted tickets to imitate a client and or manager assigning tickets to teams. In addition, once tickets are submitted with respective SLA levels assigned to created tickets, emmulate the help desk response to the created tickets being received and solved. In sum, close tickets having gone over high, middle, and low level tickets (i.e. Sev-A, Sev-B, and Sev-C level tickets) being solved.
